# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## Tools
- Wireshark (free)

## Deliverables
- Packet capture file (.pcapng)
- Short report of protocols identified

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Install Wireshark.
2. Start capture on the active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3. Browse a website or ping a server to generate traffic.
4. Stop the capture after ~1 minute.
5. Filter packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.).
6. Identify at least 3 different protocols.
7. Export capture as .pcapng.
8. Summarize findings in the report.

## Outcome
Hands-on experience in packet analysis and protocol awareness.
